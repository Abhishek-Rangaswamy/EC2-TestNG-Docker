What is TestNG Listeners?
Listeners are TestNG annotations, that literally listens to all events in the script and modify the TestNG behaviour accordingly.
These listeneres are applied as interfaces in the code.
They enable customization of test behavior, such as logging, reporting, or taking actions before, after, or when a test fails, passes, or is skipped.

Benefits of using TestNG Listeners with Selenium
Enhanced Test Reporting: By implementing listeners, you can capture and log events occurring during test execution, such as test case start, test case failure, test case success, etc.

Test Result Analysis:Define custom actions to be taken when a test fails, such as capturing a screenshot, logging additional information, or sending a notification. 
This enables you to take immediate corrective actions and facilitates efficient debugging.

Test Execution Control: Listeners allow you to define conditions and logic for executing or skipping tests based on specific criteria.
